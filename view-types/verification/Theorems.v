(** * Summary: What Must Be Proven *)

(**
  CRITICAL PATH (Must be proven for soundness):
  1. views_conflict correctness (Section 1.3)
  2. subview transitivity (Section 2.1)
  3. exclusive_mut_borrow (Section 4.1)
  4. disjoint_borrows_safe (Section 4.1)
  5. progress (Section 6.1)
  6. preservation (Section 6.2)
  7. safe_code_preserves_view_invariants (Section 7.1)
  8. view_type_safety (Section 10.2)

  IMPORTANT (Should be proven for completeness):
  - All subtyping properties (Section 2)
  - Field-level borrowing independence (Section 4.2)
  - Auto-trait properties (Section 8)
  - Variance properties (Section 9)

  NICE TO HAVE (Can be proven later):
  - Determinism
  - Specific unsafe interaction details
  - Backwards compatibility

  Total Theorems: 58
  Estimated Effort: 6-8 weeks
