// CORRECT TEST: Multi-field view spec conflict detection
//
// This test correctly exposes the soundness bug in multi-field view specs.
// The bug: only the FIRST field from multi-field view specs was checked.
//
// View-typed borrows for function arguments are SHORT-LIVED (consumed by move).
// The bug manifests when a view-typed METHOD calls ANOTHER view-typed method,
// or when there are explicit field borrows within a view-typed context.
