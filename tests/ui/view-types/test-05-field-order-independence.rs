// TEST 5: Field Order Independence
//
// PROPERTY: Field order in view specs should not affect conflict detection
//
// RATIONALE:
// The Coq formalization uses lists (ordered), but semantically view specs
// represent SETS of field accesses. The order fields appear in the view spec
// should not change conflict detection behavior.
//
// CRITICAL TESTS:
// 1. {mut a, mut b} should conflict with {mut b} the same as {mut b, mut a}
// 2. {mut a, mut b} vs {mut c, mut d} should work regardless of order
// 3. {mut a, mut b} vs {mut b, mut c} should conflict regardless of order
//
// This validates that the implementation doesn't have order-dependent bugs.

//@ check-pass
